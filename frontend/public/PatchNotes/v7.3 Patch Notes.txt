//A serious patch for serious people.


-----------------------------------------------
Balance Adjustments
-----------------------------------------------

Serious Mint Added
//A consumable item to swap your Pokémon to a neutral nature. Available for $3000 from the Slateport shopkeeper who sells Ability Patches and Capsules.


Sidney's Samurott Aerial Ace > Aqua Jet
//Will this stop a sweep someday? ...Maybe!


Breloom Egg Move Drain Punch > Wake-Up Slap
//The true Spore payoff is here (and Breloom's power is back down to earth).

Meowth Egg Move Spite > Night Slash
//This was an oversight, I'd been referring to the wrong Meowth form in the Egg Move list.


Smeargle Sketch Pool Additions:
Fissure
Light Screen
Mat Block
Reflect
Syrup Bomb
Tail Whip
//Brings the total to 48 and makes the god Smeargle a bit more elusive.


-----------------------------------------------
Death and the Afterlife
-----------------------------------------------

[REDACTED]
//A fate too terrible to describe.


-----------------------------------------------
Bugfix and QoL
-----------------------------------------------

Hall of Fame display window now shows Total Deaths instead of Player ID
//Giving the Hall of Fame screenshots a bit more punch.

Hall of Fame confetti display now waits for an input to advance beyond showing your full team
In-Game timer now stops counting when you enter the Hall of Fame room
//Allowing you however long you need to grab your screenshot.


Pokémon no longer use their Mega-Evolution Mini Sprite in the party menu after swapping out
//Player Pokemon now properly de-mega after being swapped out.

KOed Mega Pokémon no longer sometimes cause visual bugs on the HP window
//Enemy Pokemon now properly de-mega after being KOed.

Steven's Mega Metagross no longer shiny
//Sorry Steven, but your silver monstrosity was causing too many visual hiccups.


-----------------------------------------------
Pool Additions
-----------------------------------------------

Pool Addition: Inkay
//Incurs a small amount of time loss from needing to turn your monitor upside-down during evolution.


Pool Addition: Bombirdier
//Both of Bombirdier's regular abilities have been replaced with...

New Ability: Stork's Blessing
At the end of a battle against a gym leader or elite 4 member in which a Pokémon with Stork's Blessing participated, if you have an empty slot in your party, you get an egg. The egg contains a random Pokémon of the 19 possible babies. A baby obtained via Stork's Blessing hatches at level 5 with a Sky Ribbon. Pokémon with Sky Ribbons cannot gain levels via the Rare Candy.
//"Welcome to the team, Smoochum! Want to go play with the funny fire turtle?"


//Thanks for reading, thanks for updating, and thanks for playing!! I'll see everybody online next week for loads of Boxer-hosted races.
